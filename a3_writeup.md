# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
The search PA function compares the inputted queery and matches it to one of the source queries. It then finds the correct answer to the query.


2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added kingsman: secret service. it's my favorite movie.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I made a director by year function, and made a pattern to match a source for it. i think it would be nice to look up the people who directed movies in different years.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would do a similar one, but for music. the database would have artist, year, album, song, genre, etc.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
the seach PA function was pretty hard for me. I didn't even know where to start with it. i didn't think to use the action function to find the matches and call the right fnction.https://github.com/LT-IntroToAI-SY2324/a3-part2-bob.git

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes.
